Analytic Equation for the mean free path (l) of a particle is:

l = 1 / ( a * n )

with a the cross-sectional length/area of a tree/star
and n the number of trees/stars per unit area/volume

Robin Hood:

l = 1 / ( 2 * 0.005 ) = 100 meters

Olber:

l = 1 / [ pi*(7*10^8)^2 * 10^9 * (3.086*10^22)^-3 ] = 1.9*10^40 meters
